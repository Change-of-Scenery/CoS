<strong>ZENSHI</strong>

AFC Franchise Corporation’s history is rooted deep in Japanese heritage and tradition. As part of this tradition, AFC’s culture reflects the concept of “Wakei Seijyaku” a school of thought based on the combination of HARMONY, RESPECT, PURITY, AND TRANQUILITY to create a ZEN ideology. We have taken this ZEN ideology to define who we are. The meaning and application of these four concepts are as follows:

 • HARMONY - <strong>Wa</strong>kei Seijaku - We aim to build a team that works in harmony with each other and our partners. We create unique recipes that delight customers by combining distinct flavors and ingredients that work harmoniously together.

 • RESPECT - Wa<strong>kei</strong> Seijaku - We show respect for tradition and our heritage while acknowledging the need for continuous growth to meet the needs of the American palate. We show respect to each other, our partners and our consumers, the food we make, and the space we work in.

 • PURITY - Wakei <strong>Sei</strong>jaku - We take pride in ourselves, our workspaces, and the ingredients in our food by focusing on clean, sanitary, pure, and safe practices.
 
 • TRANQUILITY - Wakei Sei<strong>jaku</strong> - Staying calm and tranquil under pressure. Dealing with business matters with respect and honor.",https://local.shaws.com/ma/cohasset/739-chief-justice-cushing-hwy.html

It was founded in 1746 as one of the churches of the “Standing Order” of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.<br/><br/>The Puritans who settled the colony in the 1630’s had dreamed of establishing a Biblical Commonwealth, a theocratic state. Farthest from their minds was the idea we later would call the separation of church and state. Meetinghouses were built and maintained and the salaries of the ministers were paid by taxes levied upon the citizens. Hingham’s First Parish Church had been gathered in 1635 and its members met for worship in downtown Hingham, the first section of Hingham to be settled.<br?><br/>Gradually there came to be a large enough number of residents in South Hingham to warrant the formation of a new church there and the construction of a new meeting-house. This meeting-house was raised in 1742 on land belonging to Theophilus Cushing, and the legislature of the colony was petitioned to allow the founding of a new parish. On March 25, 1746, the parish was formally set off from the First Parish by order of the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony as the Third Parish. In 1770, as a result of some changes by the General Court to precinct designations involving Hingham and Cohasset, the Third Parish became the Second Parish, and remains so to this day. Second Parish tries to continue the basic function of the colonial parish church, serving the community as a whole, striving to fulfill its mission.",https://www.secondparish.org/

3A Marine Service, Inc. is a marine sales and service business, servicing and selling boats to 45 feet and recreational marine power. Prior to 1981, 3A Marine Service was a proprietorship owned by Edwin Lofgren who was a full time high school teacher and part time at the business.The business grew by leaps and bounds together with the high-energy economy of the 1980s and public interest in boating. Two significant steps were taken by the company in response to the above-mentioned growth. First, 3A Marine Service was incorporated and secondly, the land and buildings that house the business were purchased. This growth was chiefly spawned by our service orientation. Everything was, and is today, driven by Customer Service, and structured around a service center. Today, 3A Marine Service has an excellent reputation as one of the best marine service facilities in Massachusetts, and for Customer Service. This service, is, and will remain a focal point for the business. By 1988, growth was admittedly a management threat to business. The accountant for the business gave Mr. Lofgren a choice - run the business full time or sell to someone who would. The former route was chosen.Controlled, managed growth was a successful plan, and 3A Marine Service prospered until the recession hit.<br/><br/>
Although the business took its hits with this recession, once again a plan was developed to stay the course and to ensure the future. The business retreated into its service base, which became its chief profit center. Inventories were drastically cut to match the downsizing in sales activity.A bold step forward was taken in the newly important service department -- expansion. A new shop facility was built on location and two new full time and four new part time technicians were hired and schooled. It worked like a charm ~ people were not buying but needed service more than ever to stay on the water. There were twelve major marine dealerships on the South Shore of Boston prior to the recession. 3A Marine Service was one of the three that remained at the conclusion of the recession.In the 1980s, we developed a need for additional service space and boat storage. The two acres at 292 Lincoln Street were rented (and later purchased) from an old friend. This land and building gives us a second service center and a solid storage facility. We now employ seven full time technicians and we have maintenance and repair work that occupies us year round. In fact, service demand often strains our capabilities.Sales rebounded in 1994 and sales growth has exceeded expectations.<br/><br/>
We now handle three major boat lines: Parker, Robalo, and Four Winns. We are full sales & service dealers for three major motor lines: Yamaha, Evinrude and Tohatsu. We have developed a Parts And Accessories Department which has become a very successful additional profit center, managed by Melanie Krause, Owner & General Manager of the business. Melanie is computer literate and educated, and has led the company in this direction in the bookkeeping, service and parts department, with links to suppliers. With Melanie's guidance, we have a keen eye on the Internet, and the role it plays in our industry and our own business. Our company web site is very active and is playing a significant role in sales. With our basic service center nucleus, key lines and an eye to the economy and the future, 3A Marine Service is poised for continued success.",http://3amarine.com/

It has retained all the salient characteristics of the style, including the small square openings in the gable elevations. The six-over-six sash windows, set tightly under the eaves, the simple door enframement and the large chimney on the ridge all are indicators of the eighteenth century building date. It is recorded that up to 1927, the house had no plumbing, no electricity and no furnace. In 1876, an ell located on the south elevation was removed; it had been used as a cobbler's shop. Today, the additions include two dormers in the rear slope of the roof and a rear wing.

Recent inspections by architectural historians suggest that nothing of the original structure is intact today, though there is evidence of resue of materials from the structure in the major additions of  1715 and 1790. Entrance enlarged in 1853.The house was originally a very modest dwelling, appropriate in scale and detail for a family making a living as a cooper and maltster. Thomas Lincoln (Benjamin's great, great grandfather) started the structure in 1637 and then a later structure, now the oldest two rooms in the house, the early kitchen and the \""borning\"" room were built prior to 1667. These rooms are beautifully detailed with wainscoting and paneled walls and are kept as close to 'period correct' as possible - there is no electricity in the borning room!  Rose and Charles Woodard were presented the Bradford Sprout Award for Architectural Preservation at the 2010 Hingham Historical Society Annual Dinner. The Woodards are the 12th generation of Lincoln family descendants to live in the Benjamin Lincoln house . The house was named for the farmer and brewer who built it in the 1660s, but its most famous occupant was Benjamin Lincoln IV, a Revolutionary War hero appointed by General Washington to receive the British Army’s surrender at Yorktown in 1781.",https://hinghamhistorical.org/benjamin-lincoln-house/

When the soldier returned, he found his inheritance depleted and built the narrow house to spite his brother by blocking the sunlight and ruining his view.""<br/><br/><i>Cronin, Jim (February 13, 2005). <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/02/13/living_sideways/"" target=""_blank"">""Living sideways""</a>.

Hingham Center HM,1,,42.23971,-70.88277,Colonial,176 Main St,,Dr. Thomas Thaxter,Thaxter,,1788,0,0,"From the <i>""History of Hingham""</i>, vol. I, part II, page 323.<br/><br/>
<i>""Thomas Thaxter, second son of Major Samuel and Abigail (Smith) Thaxter, was born in Hingham, Aug. 25, 1748. After completing his early education at the public schools, and his subsequent term of medical pupilage, he commenced the practice of medicine and surgery in his native town, succeeding Dr. Bala Lincoln.<br/><br/>
    Had many influential friends and connections to encourage him; his charges were moderate; and his successful treatment in difficult cases, especially of the then prevailing throat distemper, won for him more than a local reputation. He was a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society.<br/><br/>
    While visiting the sick in town he usually rode on horseback, although when the patient resided at a distance, his square-topped chaise was brought into use. During the later years of his life, he and his son Robert, rode out together daily on horseback to visit the sick, each having his saddle-bags and riding opposite sides of the road.<br/><br/>
    Dr. Thaxter superintended the education of a number of medical students, several of whom were from other places. He was the proprietor of a drug store, the attendant being his sister, Miss Abigail Thaxter. He also gave a portion of his time to agricultural pursuits and the improvement of farm stock. His first wife, whom he married Jan. 8, 1773, died the 2nd of March following. His second wife was Mary Barker, daughter of Capt. Francis and Hannah (Thaxter) Barker, and sister of Dr. Joshua Barker. They had five children.""</i><br/><br/>
When the house was for sale, the Hingham Journal printed this listing:<br/><br/>

<i>""Valuable Real Estate at Auction - will be sold at public auction on Wednesday, Nov. 18th at 4 o'clock PM.<br/><br/>
    That well known and very desirable estate on the corner of Main & Water Streets, now occupied by Dr. R.T. Edes consisting of a commodious house, stable & other outbuildings, with about 3 acres of land.<br/><br/>
    This is one of the best situations in Hingham for a summer or permanent residence, being within a short distance of the Steamboat Loadings, Railroad Station, Post Office, Banks, Agricultural Hall, Public Library, etc. and from the highest grounds commanding a fine view of the harbor & scenery adjacent.<br/><br/>
    In fact, it needs only to be seen to be appreciated.""</i><br/><br/>    
Mr. Charles Bliss, who formerly resided at this address, was fondly and sympathetically eulogized in the Hingham Journal issue of Feb. 23, 1894.<br/><br/>
<i>""Mr. Charles I. Bliss died at his home on Main Street, last Saturday morning, after a lingering illness from that dread disease, <strong>Consumption</strong>. He was a patient sufferer and bore with true heroism the inroads which that malady made upon his physical forces.<br/><br/>
He was an agreeable and companionable gentleman and neighbor, a fine friend and closely wedded to a home life of unpretentiousness and simple honest living.<br/><br/>
He will be sadly missed among a large circle of friends & acquaintances. He leaves a widow, the oldest daughter of Mr. & Mrs. J.P. Tucker, and one child. His funeral took place on Tuesday and his remains were laid at rest in the Hingham Cemetery.""</i>

John Levett was ""the first of the name of Levett to make a permanent home in the New World."" He was in Dorchester, Massachusetts 1630/34; then, in Hingham, Massachusetts beginning in 1635.<br/><br/>Sometime during 1634/5 John's apprenticeship Master learned of his land ownership and whereabouts. This ""master"" came to Dorchester and claimed John's estate as compensation for his breaking his indenture. (On March 3, 1635, John deeded a house and lot at Dorchester to a Thomas Makepeace.)<br/><br/>Also that year, the Council of New England were ordered to relinquish their charter to King Charles. Without any land ownership, and therefore freeman status, John removed to Hingham. In 1636 and 1637 a number of lots were granted to John Leavitt at Hingham. Of the lots granted to John, the manuscripts show him receiving a ""grant of land and the training field of Leavitt street, in the vicinity of the locality known as OVER THE DELAWARE, where the Weir River is crossed by Leavitt Bridge.""<br/><br/>That is where John built his new log home about 1636. Deacon John Leavitt (later spelling) lived in his ""Old Homestead"" at 133 Leavitt Street until his death on November 20, 1691.<br/><br/>His family buried him a short distance from home in the ""Plain cemetery (Hingham Center Cemetery)"", not far from his home. His grave-stone with the following inscription: ""Here lyeth buried ye Body of Deacon John Leavitt aged 83 years Died November ye 20, 1691."" His great-great grandson, Jacob Leavitt (of Turner, Maine), would later place a permanent stone marker at his grave site. On June 25, 1949, the National Association of Leavitt Families also placed a metal memorial plaque at the site. John's wife and most of his family were buried in the Hingham Center Cemetery, as well.<br/><br/>In 1712, John's log cabin home was dismantled, and a new frame house built in its place. The exterior logs were salvaged and made into cellar steps. Some of John's posterity lived there until 1889, when it was sold. John Leavitt held many important offices in Hingham. He was a Selectman, and a Magistrate (a member of the governor's council) for many years. By 1680, he had received the title of Deacon in his church. In 1681, he continued with this title in Hingham's then-new Old Ship Meeting House.",https://www.redfin.com/MA/Hingham/133-Leavitt-St-02043/home/16364577

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;"">
It all began in 1997 when Maura Bulman, a scholar and innovator, wanted to bring to Scituate, her love of good food. Her passion for Greek Mythology solidified the Circe’s Grotto title. I came in 1998 after 25 or so years in the restaurant business learning from her the satisfaction in creating a good sandwich. I took on her dream with buying Circe’s in 2002. My passion is about quality and substance, using nothing but the best products that can be found. Sell it at a fair price. Serve it with a smile and keep them wanting more. It’s a simple philosophy. When people trust you, the world is your panino!<br/><br/>
We are a family affair!<br/><br/>

Fearing's father, Hawkes Fearing, was the owner of the successful Hingham Cordage Company, located where Town Hall is today. Albert went into the maritime business, and made his fortune as a ship chandler in the port of Boston, selling all manner of ship supplies and fittings. In the 1850s he sold his business and retired to his Hingham home as a gentleman farmer. His house, built in 1640 and acquired by Fearing, later became St. Paul's Rectory, and his land extended north over the hill where Miles Road and Burditt Avenue are today, all the way to Broad Cove. Hence the origin of ""Fearing Road."" He was a philanthropist and co-founded the Hingham Agricultural and Horticultural Society, dedicated to scientific principles in farming.

Prior to the war of the Revolution he constructed a clock for the old meeting-house, ""the dial of which appeared in the dormer-window on the southwesterly slope of the roof, and was thus visible to the public.""<br/><br/>Tradition says that he built a church organ and set it up in the old meeting-house, where it stood for a while, and that it was eventually sold to go to Portland, Me.<br/><br/>I find no record, however, to verify this tradition; but that several years later he was a professional organ builder at Boston is certain.<br/><br/>In 1773 he built and resided in the house now owned and occupied by heirs of George Bassett on Main, corner of Elm Street.<br/><br/>This dwelling he sold in 1777 to Joseph Blake, and soon after removed to Boston. The Selectmen's Book of Records, Vol. II., show that as a physician he received a fair share of the patronage of the town, as no doubt he did from the public. His inventive perceptions, however, led him to seek other fields of employment. He was the son of Hezekiah and Grace (Hatch) Leavitt, and was born in Hingham Oct. 21, 1744. The Christian name of his wife was Azubah. She died at Boston Nov., 1803, aged 40 years. He died March, 1804, aged 59 years.<br/><br/>
The Hingham Journal prints ""enlightening"" news about another owner of this house.<br/><br/>
<i>""Mr. Geo. Bassett, the stable keeper has been shedding light upon his neighborhood by putting up the first street lamp in town. It is located on the corner of Main & Elm Streets & its brilliant beams shed a cheerful light which is see for quite a distance.<br/><br/>
We learn that several residents are so well pleased with the project that they intend to follow his lead, & it is hoped that others will be inclined to extend a good work so nobly begun.<br/><br/>
We understand that after the first outlay of putting up the arrangements, the expense of maintaining the light is but trifling. Every one, we think, will agree with us, that nothing looks more cheerful, or condues more to public safety than a street well lighted on a dark night.""</i><br/><br/>
Among the owners of this house were Joseph Blake Jr. (1781), Joshua Barker (1790), George Bassett (1857), Heirs of George Bassett (1890), George P. Cushing (1904), Harriet A. Cushing (1931), Hingham Trust Company Trustees (1940), John T. & Lee M. Corwin (1962), Lee M. Corwin (1967), Robert L. Palmer (1974).

The segregationist tradition of New England church seating patterns prevailed here. In April 1836, member Timothy Gilbert, later an active financial supporter of the Boston Vigilance Committee, tested the church’s racial segregation policy by inviting several African Americans to join him in his pew. The church immediately expelled Gilbert for this violation. He soon set out with several other members to form the First Free Baptist Church. Officially recognized in 1839, this church eventually became Tremont Temple, the first church in Boston to abolish pew rental fees.

Things changed, however, when Maurizio scratched a $5.00 lottery ticket and won one million dollars. Most people quit their jobs and relax,but not Maurizio. He works harder than ever.  Living a lifetime dream,he made his mother Concetta’s meatballs famous when he opened Ristorante Limoncello on the Freedom Trail next to Paul Reveres House in the North End of Boston.   Although life is good for Maurizio, he would be much wealthier if he weren’t so generous.  His motto is you get back what you give.   He wants the atmosphere in his restaurant to make you feel like you are eating in his home.  From the minute you walk in, you feel like you are a part of his family.  You may notice he has had the same staff for years, made up of many family members. Head Chef Andrea Moggi, who has been with him since day one,brings in the love of fine Italian food through many of his recipes and creations from the Amalfi Coast. His brother Sergio, along with chefs Nicola and Manuel complete the authentic Italian kitchen. Corrado (Chico) and Luisa (Loulou ), his brother and sister, make sure your dining experience is perfect as they serve you.  Completing the dining room staff is Susan, Sabino, Antonio, Jake, Lorrin and Sandra who have been longtime, loyal employees and friends. Expect  a kiss or hug when you enter or leave the restaurant because when visiting Limoncello you are dining with friends. Maurizio’s mother Concetta’s memory lingers throughout the restaurant through her recipes and her constant presence before her passing in 2015.

Around 1742 Samuel first married Mary Bates. Born c. 1723, Mary died on 3 Jul 1763 in Hingham, at age 40. They had 2 children together. On 16 Oct 1763 when Samuel was 49, he second married Frances Jones. Born c. 1723, Frances died on 21 Jul 1781 in Hingham, MA.<br/><br/>126 South Street was purchased by Samuel Lincoln. Jr. (1690/91-1758) around 1752. Samuel, a carpenter and sheriff, had previously built 170 North Street in 1721. Upon Samuel's death in 1758, his son, John Lincoln (1735-1811), a Revolutionary War captain, briefly held the property until 1761. Both Samuel and John Lincoln were descended from the first Samuel Lincoln (1622-1690) who came to Hingham in 1637.<br/><br/>Jedediah Beal (1688-1766) acquired 126 South Street in 1761 but died in 1766. His son, Jedediah (1717-1805), who fought in the Revolutionary War, only kept the property until 1768, when it appears he may have moved to Abington.<br/><br/>In 1768, 126 South Street was purchased by Ebed Hersey (1738/39-1836) and is one of the oldest Hingham houses associated with the Hersey family. Ebed is also associated with 120 and 122-24 South Street and there are other Hersey homes in the nearby area at 132, 139-41, 158-60 South Street and 2 South Lane. When known as the Jonathan Hersey House, the house references Ebed's son. Jonathan (b. 1764), a mariner who was lost at sea. All the Ebed Hersey family, which retained the property until the late 1860s, were descended from William Hersey (d. 1657-58), the original founder of the Hersey family in America. who emigrated from Berkshire, England, to Hingham in 1635.<br/><br/>Hingham homeopathic physician Henry Edwin Spalding (1843-1912). who fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862, owned 126 South Street from 1880 to 1897. The next owner was William Allen Vining (1839-1921), a foreman at the nearby Cushing House stables, and the property stayed in the family until 1929.<br/><br/>This early ridge and gambreled roof cottage has an interesting architectural history which has yet to be definitive. The Julian C. Loring records indicate that the cottage was built in the mid-eighteenth century, while visual evidence of the exterior and the interior, suggests that a late seventeenth century building date could be possible. The obvious exterior clue to an earlier date is the placement of the nine-over-nine sash windows, tightly under the eaves, and over the narrow cornice boards. This indicates the existence of very low rooms, typical of the late seventeenth century. The interior woodwork was examined by the late John Richardson who also concurred that this could be an earlier house. Originally, the house was a one-story residence with a ridge roof which became a gambreled roof when the loft above was extended to create two rooms above. Later, the top slope of the gambrel was elongated to the present roof configuration. The placement of the chimney, in the center of the slope of the top gambrel is another evidence.of the numerous alterations and enlargements undergone by the Samuel Lincoln House. One of the later additions is the fine enclosed pedimented entrance portico with sidelights framing the door. The Samuel Lincoln Jr. House is a fine reminder of South Street's early history.<br/><br/>Much of the above text is courtesy of Fannin/Lehner for the Hingham Historical Commission",https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2-South-Ln-Hingham-MA-02043/56639133_zpid/

West Hingham HM,1,,42.24031,-70.90296,Colonial,319 North St,,Thomas Lincoln,Lincoln,"810,800",1650,2357,0,"It is possible that this Colonial house at 319 North Street is one of, if not the oldest house in Hingham. It is shown in process of renovation in 2017. (First photo.) Located on Mars Hill, a spur of Baker's Hill which occurs at the last bend of North Street, the house or portions thereof, belonged to early Hingham settler Thomas Lincoln (d.1691). Known as the ""cooper"" or ""malster;"" Thomas Lincoln appears in the Hingham records of 1636 and many of his descendants established themselves along North and South Streets. Thomas Lincoln, weaver, came from Old Hingham in England. He is said to have resided for a couple of years in Charlestown and Watertown. He received a grant of land in Hingham at what was known as ""Weary-All"" (now Otis Hill) in 1635. On July 3, 1636, he was granted a house lot of 5 acres on the then ""south side"" of town--now South Street.<br/><br/>The early history of the house at 319 North Street is not completely clear but it is agreed that the house was moved, apparently from South Street near the junction of South, Fort Hill, and West Streets, the later site of the West Hingham Railroad Station. It was moved across the frozen marshes of the Town Swamp in the winter... When the house was moved is another question; George Lincoln refers to Thomas Lincoln's homestead on ""North, near Beal Street."" which implies Lincoln moved the house. Others date the move to 1735. after Lincoln's lifetime which ended in 1691.<br/><br/>In any case, eight generations of the Thomas Lincoln ""Cooper"" family lived at 319 North Street encompassing over 250 years of ownership, ending with the death of the long-lived Horace Lincoln (1849-1939). Thomas left 319 North Street to his son. Joseph (1640-1715/16), who in turn willed it to his son, Nehemiah (1688-1771). As Nehemiah had no children, 319 North Street was inherited by Israel Lincoln (1723-1810), a nephew. who kept it until 1792. It was at this point that the colorful Captain Barnabas Lincoln (1751-1822) came into possession of 319 North Street.<br/><br/>Master mariner Barnabas was one of the owners of the sloop \""New Forge\"" of Hingham, built in Hanover, Mass. in 1792. Thirty years later, in 1822, Barnabas had the harrowing experience of being attacked by pirates who boarded the Hannah of Boston while the schooner was in Cuban waters. Although Barnabas survived the experience, and he was in fact rescued by a friendly pirate, the ordeal was too much for him and he died later the same year.<br/><br/>Following Barnabas Lincoln's death, 319 North Street passed into the possession of his son in-law, mason/contractor and veteran of the War of 1812 Moses L. Humphrey (1778-1834) who had married Sarah Lincoln in 1801. Moses. who resided on Cottage Street, kept the property only until 1826, probably giving it as a wedding present to his son, cooper Leavitt Humphrey, who had married Meriel Stodder that year.<br/><br/>The house was divided before 1840. Leavitt Humphrey continued to own the 321 North Street section until at least 1873. Tinsmith Charles Stewart (1833-1901), who had a distinguished seven year naval career during the Civil War, owned 321 North Street from c. 1878 until his death in 1901 and his heirs until after 1945.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Thomas Lincoln's direct descendants continued in the 319 North Street section of the house. Charles Lincoln (1797-1881), Barnabas' son, was in residence in 1840, followed by Benjamin Stowell Lincoln (1811-1890), who followed the sea as did his grandfather Barnabas before him. Horace Lincoln (1849), a shoemaker, acquired the property from his father Benjamin in 1890 and owned it until his death. Horace's heirs kept the property until about 1945 when it was sold out of the Lincoln family.<br/><br/>Note: This info is sourced in part by the publicly available online genealogy of the Lincoln family of Hingham, as well as details from Hingham Historical Society documentation about the property.DESCRIPTION FROM 2017 Hingham House Tour: Thomas Lincoln, the cooper, came to Hingham in 1635, probably from Dorchester, MA with his young wife, Avith Lane, and her brothers, George and Andrew, a shoemaker and a feltmaker, respectively. The families received grants of land on Town (North) Street near Beal Street. Unlike most of their East Anglian bred neighbors, these newcomers were originally from England’s West Country, and spoke in a markedly different English dialect. According to various sources, Thomas’s house is the oldest in Hingham, and was moved to this site from South Street. No evidence exists to prove or disprove these claims, but the framing methods and woods used are typical of the 17th century. Framing evidence also suggests that Thomas’s house was originally a one room structure tucked into Mars Hill, which once projected further out into North Street.<br/><br/>Later generations expanded the little house, adding first to the side and then above and back, into the hill. A curious result of those improvements was the relocation of the kitchen to the second floor rear in the early 1700s. That meant the new cooking fireplace had to be squeezed into an existing chimney stack.<br/><br/>In 1810 Barnabas Lincoln, Sr. sold the eastern half the house to his son-in-law Moses Humphrey, officially establishing a two-family residence. In later years, one half of the house was occasionally unoccupied, but as several of the Lincoln women were widowed young, the empty half of the old homestead often served as a haven until they were on their feet again. The last Lincoln to live here was Horace, who passed away, nearly penniless, in 1939. After that the house was converted to a single residence. The Thomas Lincoln house is being properly restored and updated by Wilcox Corp. of Hingham, and will again house two families. A mid 1800s photo, attached, looks out at 319-321 North Street from the northwest, to the backs of the houses on South Street beyond. The marsh between the two streets, which is today overgrown with trees and bush, appears to have been carefully tended and irrigated in the nineteenth century. Note the many outbuildings attending each house—they indicate a community where agriculture is a key part of the economy.

Adjacent to historic Hingham Square lie 13 acres of open parkland — rolling hills and terraces known as Hingham Cemetery. Established over 340 years ago c. 1672, the privately-owned cemetery is the resting place of numerous state and national patriots, statesmen, militia, and townspeople who helped build and shape our country. It is one of the few historical cemeteries with lots still available for sale.<br/><br/>
The grounds also encompass Hingham’s only Veterans’ burial area, its only arboretum, and a Memorial Garden for cremations. Two town-owned monuments (the Settler’s Monument seen on the town seal, and the Civil War obelisk) are located in the cemetery. The site also contains many colonial slate headstones, some credited to noted headstone carvers of the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as Victorian artwork by three major American sculptors of the 19th century.<br/><br/>
A professional landscape crew helps maintain the grounds to insure that the lawns and gardens remain attractive to family and friends. We encourage visitors to enjoy the grounds, trees, and monuments in this quiet, contemplative setting one block from Hingham Square. School groups, researchers and visitors from around the globe visit year round. <br/><br/>
Run by a group of dedicated, unpaid volunteer Board of Directors, Hingham Cemetery is a non-profit, non-sectarian organization serving the town of Hingham. Our emphasis today is not only the renewal of the 175-yr-old arboretum and the Colonial and Victorian areas, but also the incorporation of our newer Water Street area. <br/><br/>

Daniel Whiton bought the property to build his fine Georgian house here in 1757. The property remained in the Whiton family until 1916.<br/><br/>The Whitons were wealthy farmers and carpenters. They also served as town constables. Two Whitons fought in the Revolutionary War. Joseph Jacob Whiton, Daniel’s eldest great grandson and successful Boston clothing merchant, died without any children, so his brother Amasa, inherited Daniel’s Boston and Hingham properties, valued at a then-sizeable $159,000 in 1863. Amasa served as a state senator, member if the school committee and trustee of the library. Amasa’s wife, Hannah (Fearing) Whiting, owned the property after his death. She lived until age 85, and her travels between Boston and Hingham would frequently be covered in the Hingham Journal. Ada Bacon, Hannah’s daughter, eventually sold the 1217 Main Street property out of the family.<br/><br/>In 1938, Otto and Herberta Kley bought the home and established the Country Fare restaurant there. The Country Fare became a Duncan Hines-recommended restaurant and served Hingham for more than 40 years. During that time, Otto and Herberta lived upstairs. For 16 years, a new owner would operate the restaurant as the Whiton House. Then, with changes in ownership it was for a brief time the restaurant Siros, followed by the Black Fin Chop House (2003-2005.) Since 2007, The Scarlet Oak, owned by Jed and Joshua Webber (the Webber Restaurant Group), has operated here. The name “The Scarlet Oak” was inspired by a grove of scarlet oak trees that were once on the property. The old barn adjacent to the original structure has now been incorporated on the first floor as part of the restaurant’s kitchen area.",https://www.scarletoaktavern.com

Scituate,1,,42.1956,-70.72477,,132 Front St,,Welch Company,Boutique,,,,,"<strong>OUR STORY</strong><br/><br/>Since its founding in 1879 by George Welch, the Welch Company has been dedicated to providing shoppers on Boston's South Shore with quality merchandise and an unmatched level of customer service. It’s a core commitment which has remained unchanged for nearly 140 years and continues today.  But, oh, how everything else has changed!<br/><br/>Originally a general store, the Welch Company offered Scituate residents utilitarian wares such as hardware and paint in a rambling old building on the waterfront. Over the decades, the selection evolved and, where once locals came in for a box of nails or a bucket of paint, the Welch Company became the store where people from throughout the region found decorative items for the home and unique gifts.<br/><br/>In 2006, the Welch Company moved into a new location. We’re still located on Front Street, overlooking Scituate’s beautiful waterfront, but we now occupy two floors of space where floor-to-ceiling windows frame the views of the harbor and fill the shop with sunlight.<br/><br/>You’ll no longer find hammers and hardware at the Welch Company. What you will find is handmade jewelry and original artwork. You’ll also find exquisite linens, pillows and throws from Matouk, Sferra and other fine companies. We have an endless selection of home décor accessories as well as tableware from Juliska and Mariposa and stemware from Rolf Glass. We also carry lighting from Currey & Company, Visual Comfort, Jamie Young and home furnishings, which you’ll find arranged throughout the shop in thoughtful vignettes designed to inspire. We invite you to come and explore our store on your next trip to Scituate Harbor.",http://www.welchcompany.com/
Reeds Corner,1,,42.2223,-70.80305,,750 Chief Justice Cushing Hwy,,Teodora's,Butcher,,,,,"<div style=""text-align:center""><strong>The story behind our family ranch</strong><br/><br/>
As I child, I would spend my days on Dad’s ranch, which could only be accessed by a long and narrow dirt road. The site had no running water or electricity! Of course those days had changed for a more modem lifestyle. I lived my days among the cattle, enjoying simple the things you can only find in the serenity of the countryside and farm life . My precious time growing up on the ranch is the foundation for the passionate and tenacious woman I have become.
</div><br/>
My Father is my true inspiration and my fortitude comes from him. Dad built his successful Ranch business from the ground up under very difficult circumstances. Watching him overcome these seemingly unsurmountable obstacles instilled in my heart my lifelong passion for the ranch life. He received great satisfaction in producing the highest quality grass fed meat through the best practices it came naturally to him : the sustainable ranch practices, humane treatment of the animals, hard work, and an honest trade.<br/><br/>
But, I'm also grateful that I'm the daughter of Manoel Teodoro . His only daughter who followed his footsteps and the love for cattle Ranch life and how important is to take care of the land and the animals so they can take take of us . My Dad’s life journey and legacy has always proved to me that I can do hard things.<br/><br/>
So - this may sound pretty elementary, but I'm a forever daddy's girl.

In 2022, the Town of Scituate acquired the property and commissioned a committee to explore alternatives for the use of the truly unique land and buildings.</div></div>
<br/>
<a href='https://www.nsrwa.org/listing/mordecai-lincoln-mill/' target='_blank'>Mordecai Lincoln</a>, a blacksmith, built a house on this property before 1695, as well as a series of mills — a sawmill and grist mill at the mouth of Bound Brook, another mill farther upstream, and another even farther up, near Cohasset’s Lily Pond. Water flow was insufficient for powering any of the mills for more than two days at a time, so Lincoln staged his operations, employing vertical water wheels and a series of dams. He’d work for two days at one dam, until the water ran out, then move downstream to the next. The dam at today’s Mordecai Lincoln Road (formerly Blossom Street) quickly became a roadway, and a much more convenient way to cross the stream.<br/><br/>
After 1810, Caleb Lincoln, a descendent of Mordecai, sold the mill properties out of the family. The mills were renovated or reconstructed in the mid-1800s, with turbines replacing the water wheels. Ownership shifted again in 1882. The final milling operation on this site — Lincoln Mill Grain and Feed Company — existed from about 1905 to 1922. After it failed, John Cornett took over the site, with the Ladd family to follow in 1957.<br/><br/>
On the more spooky side, <a href='https://www.scituation.net/features/2020/01/19/the-ghouls-of-massachusetts/' target='_blank'>legend has it</a> that a young girl drowned in the adjacent pond across the street and now has taken permanent residency in the mill which runs along the road. Residents have reported seeing a little girl scratching at the windows as well as hearing screams from the barn and surrounding wetlands. Little wet footprints have also been seen on the road in front of the building.<br/><br/>

You could be in one of them! The Tavern has been around since 1795. A gathering place for printers and politicians, sailors and students, it quickly became the most famous alehouse in the city. What was it about the Bell that made it so popular?<br/><br/>Maybe it was Jimmy Wilson, the first owner. Everybody in Boston knew Jimmy. Not that they had much choice. You see, Jimmy was Boston’s town crier for fifty years. Good news or bad, Bostonians heard it all from Jimmy. He reported on everything from the Boston Tea Party to the birth of the nation. When he retired, he decided to open a tavern. He was proud of his former occupation and that’s why he called the place the Bell-in-Hand.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the ale. Not one for “hard stuff”, Jimmy refused to sell the whiskey, rum and gin so popular in other taverns of the day. No, only ale would be served at the Bell, but what an ale! So thick, it was served in two mugs, one for the ale and the second for the froth. It’s quite possible that the ale became better known than Jimmy.</div>",https://thebellinhand.com/

The location of the house, subsequently referred to as the ""paternal homestead"", on Hingham's oldest street (1635), was described in 1893 as ""North Street, near Hobart's Bridge."" this being the bridge named for the Hobart family which spanned the now covered-over Town Brook just east of Thaxter Street between North and South Streets.<br/><br/>Samuel Hobart and his family were descendants of Edmund Hobart (born c. 1570) who had come to Hingham, Massachusetts from Hingham, England, in 1633. Edmund's son was the well-known Reverend Peter Hobart (1604-1679), the first minister of the First Parish in Hingham. Upon Samuel's death in 1718, his son James (1689-1744), a constable in 1733, inherited the property. The house was shortly divided into a double residence as James was noted as residing ""on east part of the paternal homestead"", James' two sons, James (1727-1794) and John (1731-1791) each inherited one half of the property when he died in 1744. They each remained in residence until their respective deaths in 1791 and 1794. John, a farmer as well as a constable in 1760, 1766, and 1783, left his section of the house to his son, Shubal (1767-1800), a blacksmith. Following Shubal's death in 1800, his wife, Sabina, remained in residence until 1854, her death ending one hundred sixty-seven years of Hobart proprietorship. For the next thirty years there was a fairly regular turnover of ownership. In 1886, Charles Burke, a laborer, bought the property at public auction and the Burke family resided at 217 North Street until 1951. More recently, in 1982, the home was acquired by Alden and Blanche ""Becky"" Weston, (both since deseased) who began to restore it. Later the property was sold to Joyce Sullivan, who was the owner when the home was featured as part of a Hingham Historical Society house tour (Much of preceding text from a Minxie Fannin text for the Hingham Historical Commission.)<br/><br/> More about Samuel Hobart's life: Samuel Hobart, son of Edmund, was born ~ 1645 in Charlestown and became known as a yeoman (owner of a small farm.) He married Hannah Gold in 1673, was the father of James Hobart. Their home on North Street was near what was called ""Hobart's Bridge."" (A stream bed is still visible in this area today.)

SEE, PAUL'S A WAHLBERG & THE WAHLBERGS ARE NO ORDINARY FAMILY.<br/></br/>
One brother, Donnie, didn't just join the school band as a kid. He created the most famous boy band in the world. His younger brother, Mark, didn't just take drama. He became one of the most famous actors in the world. And for Paul, well, he loved food and his family. But he wasn't satisfied cooking for just them. He wanted to cook for everyone else's family too. He was hungry for something more.<br/><br/>

The Gardner family was one of the earliest to settle this area—John Garnet, or Gardner, came to Hingham from England in 1650 and received a land grant in 1656. His many descendants lived and farmed along Main Street and what is now Gardner Street for over two centuries.<br/><br/>The principal crops raised in this area were Indian corn; wheat, rye, oats, and barley for food; hemp and flax for clothing; and apples for cider. John Gardner was not affluent: his estate upon his death in 1669 totaled £44, including “the Goats that have been sold to pay debts and maintain the family.” His widow, Mary, remarried into the Chubbuck family, which also had settled Liberty Plain, and in 1692, she conveyed a small portion of her property to the third of her five sons, James.<br/><br/>James Gardner was at that time 33 years old, married, with three children. While we have no written record of the date on which the earliest construction occurred on this lot, it is reasonable to assume that the land was conveyed in order to allow James to build his family a house and that he did so immediately.<br/><br/>The lots around James’ small lot were owned by his mother and brothers and later his nephews and cousins, who presumably farmed together. James’ own small plot was inherited by his son Nathaniel and grandson Noah before being absorbed into the larger holdings of their Gardner relatives.<br/><br/>In the late 18th and early 19th century, Solomon Gardner held title to a large farm, which included James Gardner’s former house, which Solomon doubled in size. Solomon Gardner’s handsome gravestone can be viewed in Liberty Plain Cemetery, a few blocks north on Main Street.<br/><br/>In 1934, Luigi Marchesiani purchased the farm. Together with his brother, James, who lived across the street, the Marchesiani family also farmed the land—renamed Pushcart Farm—for the rest of the 20th century. The last of the Marchesiani farmlands is now preserved by the Town of Hingham as the 25-acre “Marchesiani Parkland,” to the immediate south of the house. For a time after the Marchesiani’s left 1126 Main Street, a commercial laundry was operated out of the barn. Some of the equipment can still be seen there.",https://www.redfin.com/MA/Hingham/1126-Main-St-02043/home/16359917

The space was bright, it was welcoming, and it was me. It is where I developed my love for decor and making a space a home. It's where I cultivated my entrepreneurial spirit, my work ethic and my style - knowing that one day I wanted to turn those things into my career.<br/><br/><strong>Spring</strong><br/><br/>Fast forward 12 years, my husband and I bought our first home on Spring Street. The excitement of creating a space that was ours was so overwhelming that I would spend hours upon hours researching different styles, furniture, decor, and design ideas online. I knew I wanted our space to be similar to my first apartment - inviting and comfortable, really bright and refreshing, and with our New England roots, what I call a clean, coastal vibe.<br/><br/><strong>Thacher & Spring</strong><br/><br/>With a never-ending entrepreneurial spirit and years of brand marketing experience, I decided to take my love for home decor and retail to the next level and open Thacher & Spring.

Planet Fitness was founded in 1992, in Dover, NH. In the beginning, it operated much like every other gym in its small hometown and catered to the same small percentage of the population in the U.S. who worked out and belonged to a health club.<br/><br/>
PF’s owners quickly recognized that there was a greater opportunity to serve a much larger segment of the population. They asked themselves, “Why does 80-85% of the population not belong to a gym?” The answer? First-time and casual gym users didn’t like the “look at me” attitudes and behaviors found in typical gyms, and they didn’t want to have to pay a lot of money to give fitness a try.",https://www.planetfitness.com/gyms/hingham-ma?utm_medium=organic

In 1988 I had an idea that Boston and the suburbs needed a family-oriented food retailer. A place where the young and old, families, professionals, laborers, students and most anyone, could buy homemade Italian foods at very affordable prices.
The idea was put to work when the first Comella's opened in Wellesley, MA. The concept was to make fresh pastas, sauces and dinners to be served at your home or at Comella's.<br/><br/>
That hasn't changed and years later we still make all our products at each site by hand, using only the highest quality ingredients. Two of my sons, Matt and JP, joined the company upon graduation from college. They continue to look at expanding the company and opening more stores in the near future. The future's still bright as our products and pricing fit the economic conditions of the times more so today than ever before…<br/><br/>

On 16 Oct 1763 when Samuel was 49, he second married Frances Jones. Born c. 1723, Frances died on 21 Jul 1781 in Hingham, MA.<br/><br/>126 South Street was purchased by Samuel Lincoln. Jr. (1690/91-1758) around 1752. Samuel, a carpenter and sheriff, had previously built 170 North Street in 1721. Upon Samuel's death in 1758, his son, John Lincoln (1735-1811), a Revolutionary War captain, briefly held the property until 1761. Both Samuel and John Lincoln were descended from the first Samuel Lincoln (1622-1690) who came to Hingham in 1637.<br/><br/>Jedediah Beal (1688-1766) acquired 126 South Street in 1761 but died in 1766. His son, Jedediah (1717-1805), who fought in the Revolutionary War, only kept the property until 1768, when it appears he may have moved to Abington.<br/><br/>In 1768, 126 South Street was purchased by Ebed Hersey (1738/39-1836) and is one of the oldest Hingham houses associated with the Hersey family. Ebed is also associated with 120 and 122-24 South Street and there are other Hersey homes in the nearby area at 132, 139-41, 158-60 South Street and 2 South Lane. When known as the Jonathan Hersey House, the house references Ebed's son. Jonathan (b. 1764), a mariner who was lost at sea. All the Ebed Hersey family, which retained the property until the late 1860s, were descended from William Hersey (d. 1657-58), the original founder of the Hersey family in America. who emigrated from Berkshire, England, to Hingham in 1635.<br/><br/>Hingham homeopathic physician Henry Edwin Spalding (1843-1912). who fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862, owned 126 South Street from 1880 to 1897. The next owner was William Allen Vining (1839-1921), a foreman at the nearby Cushing House stables, and the property stayed in the family until 1929.<br/><br/>This early ridge and gambreled roof cottage has an interesting architectural history which has yet to be definitive. The Julian C. Loring records indicate that the cottage was built in the mid-eighteenth century, while visual evidence of the exterior and the interior, suggests that a late seventeenth century building date could be possible. The obvious exterior clue to an earlier date is the placement of the nine-over-nine sash windows, tightly under the eaves, and over the narrow cornice boards. This indicates the existence of very low rooms, typical of the late seventeenth century. The interior woodwork was examined by the late John Richardson who also concurred that this could be an earlier house. Originally, the house was a one-story residence with a ridge roof which became a gambreled roof when the loft above was extended to create two rooms above. Later, the top slope of the gambrel was elongated to the present roof configuration. The placement of the chimney, in the center of the slope of the top gambrel is another evidence.of the numerous alterations and enlargements undergone by the Samuel Lincoln House. One of the later additions is the fine enclosed pedimented entrance portico with sidelights framing the door. The Samuel Lincoln Jr. House is a fine reminder of South Street's early history.<br/><br/>Much of the above text is courtesy of Fannin/Lehner for the Hingham Historical Commission",https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/126-South-St-Hingham-MA-02043/56639280_zpid/?

In the early 1990s, Dayton-Hudson Corporation (then the parent company of Target, Mervyn's, Dayton's, Hudson's, and Marshall Field's) looked to establish a new division branded as a less expensive version of Gap called Everyday Hero; Gap's then-CEO Millard Drexler responded by opening Gap Warehouse in existing Gap outlet locations in 1993.<br/><br/>
On March 11, 1994, Gap Warehouse was renamed Old Navy Clothing Co. to establish a separate image from its parent company Gap Inc. The name was conceived after the other original proposed names, Monorail and Forklift, were disliked by Drexler, and decided upon the new name after seeing a building with the two words on it during a visit to Paris. The new stores were about 15,000 square feet (1,400 m2), compared to less than 10,000 square feet (900 m2) for Gap Warehouse stores. On March 11, 1994, the first Old Navy locations opened in the northern California towns of Colma, San Leandro and Pittsburg. According to Kevin Lonergan, Gap's director of stores, Old Navy stores were intentionally designed like grocery stores, with flowing aisles, shopping carts, and small impulse items near the checkout counters.[1] The cement floor, metal shelving, and checkout counters built from polished pressed board and galvanized metal gave the stores an industrial warehouse feel, while the colorful arrangements and large number of employees working set it apart from other discount clothing stores. Later that year, 42 other Old Navy stores opened, and most of the 45 Gap Warehouse stores were renamed Old Navy.",https://oldnavy.gap.com/stores/ma/hingham/oldnavy-5427.html

Following the resignation of the incumbent minister, a schism developed over the choice of a successor. Four deacons and a number of members of the church, followed by a substantial minority of the residents of the North Parish, withdrew from the old meeting house.<br/><br/>The dissident group held its worship services in the old Derby Academy building on Main Street while work began on a “new North meeting house” at the foot of Lincoln Street. The frame of the new structure was completed on October 25, 1806 and the finished sanctuary was dedicated on June 17, 1807. The building design has long been credited to Charles Bulfinch, architect of the State House in Boston and other memorable buildings of the era. Whether or not Bulfinch actually drew up the plans, the building’s classic style clearly shows his influence.

We love coffee, and like any overly-­involved parent, we want our coffee to be the best damn coffee out there. So, years ago­ from the comfort of our home,­ we began to roast. What began as a hobby quickly evolved into a mission. Hour after hour, day after day, we romanced flavors from the most carefully planted, tended, and processed beans out there. Today our passion project is known as Redeye Coffee Roasters, and it is the only artisan roastery and café in south suburban Boston.<br/><br/>
Every day, we roast in pursuit of perfection. We spend our time fiddling, tweaking and tasting until we are absolutely satisfied with the flavor. We brew with that same level of care, choosing carefully from our­ outrageously superior arsenal of coffee makers.<br/><br/>
Now, we can’t promise that a cup of our coffee will shake you to the core, or alter your perception of the known universe. What we can promise you is a vibrantly flavored, flawlessly frothed, top-­notch cup of liquid happiness. Plus, great company and a killer ocean view.",http://redeyeroasters.com/

In passing the house of Bela Remington, farther down the street, the rascals threw stones directly through the windows of his house, alarming the family, who upon investigation found their windows broken & stones which had done the mischief on the floor.

Cohasset,1,,42.24322,-70.80365,,43 Highland Ave,,Second Congregational Church,Church,,,,,"<strong>Our History</strong><br/><br/>The Second Congregational church was organized in 1812 by twenty-seven former parishioners of the First Parish Church. For approximately four years, services were held in a schoolroom. Nichols Tower, one of the original founders, owned large tracts of land around the Common and Little Harbor and gave a piece of land for the new church directly opposite the old church. To some, “To put up a rival church so near was called…a bare-faced effrontery…”<br/><br/>The parishioners were not deterred and a church was built at a cost of $3,500. Church records report that one faithful woman would attend services in the evening in secret by throwing her shawl and hat out an upper story window, then leaving the house unobserved. The original building had sixty pews that cost $60 each, and subscribers received deeds to their pew. The money went toward the cost of construction, which nearly exhausted the church finances. The Massachusetts Domestic Ministry sent the first regular minister in the new building. Had they not promised the aid of a Congregational minister, the new church might have become a Baptist church as several of the principal members held Baptist beliefs.<br/><br/>The church building has undergone many changes over the years. A fire ravished the building in 1928 after which the building was remodeled and enlarged.",https://2ndcc.org/

Jeremiah Lincoln, blacksmith, had just bought the 1740s Elijah Hersey house on this site in 1766, when it was entirely consumed by a late night fire. Everyone abed, they all would have perished if an apprentice hadn’t just then arrived home from a courting visit and noticed the fire, already blazing. Lincoln’s 6-year-old daughter was rescued by breaking an upper floor window and pulling her out, still asleep. Nine years before the fire Jeremiah had survived a brutal ambush by the French-allied Hurons at Fort William Henry and had been taken to Canada as a prisoner. He escaped, enduring a months-long journey home in which he and a companion nearly starved to death. They survived on tree bark.<br/><br/>He maintained his commission as a Lieutenant, but, understandably perhaps, sat out the Revolutionary War, serving instead as town constable. The house is in the “Georgian” taste, typical of the 1760s when Jeremiah rebuilt after the fire: a large central chimney, a prominent, projecting front entrance and quoins on the corners are all hallmarks of that era.<br/><br/>The Lincolns sold the house when Jeremiah was 66, after they'd reared 10 children. Dr. Levi Lincoln and his wife owned it for 30 years. Beginning in 1830 the Homestead would be owned by a series of Herseys who were brick layers, shoemakers and farmers. Hingham Journal records note that successive owners put the house through several renovations. A large Victorian “piazza” was even added in the early 1890s, when the popularity of socializing on the front porch was at its height.<br/><br/>Genealogy for Jeremiah  Lincoln: Born on 28 Oct 1733 in Hingham, MA. Occupation: Blacksmith. Jeremiah and Sarah moved to Lunenburg, MA. On 3 Apr 1760 when Jeremiah was 26, he married Sarah Hersey, daughter of Noah Hersey (24 Feb 1709/10-29 Jun 1755) & Alice Mitchell (23 Dec 1714-26 Dec 1779), in Hingham, MA.

Weaver purchased 132 Main Street's land in 1700 from cordwainer Samuel Thaxter (1641-1725), this house lot having been part of the large Thaxter family holdings in Bachelor's Row.

Seymour died in 1893, his share went to his wife, Martha A. Seymour. The 132 and 136 Main Street properties were divided in 1905 and 132 Main Street stayed with Martha A.
